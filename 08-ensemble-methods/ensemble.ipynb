    "**Bagging** (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble method that trains multiple models (typically of the same type) independently on different subsets of the data, which are created via bootstrapping. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions for regression tasks or taking a vote for classification tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Generate multiple subsets** of the training dataset using random sampling with replacement (bootstrapping).\n",
    "2. **Train the same model** on each subset.\n",
    "3. **For classification**: Aggregate the results using a majority vote.\n",
    "   **For regression**: Take the average of the predictions.\n"
