    "**Model evaluation** is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline. It involves assessing the performance of a machine learning model to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data. Evaluation helps us understand how well our model is performing and provides insights into how we can improve it.\n",

    "### Why Do We Need Model Evaluation?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance Assessment**: To determine how well our model performs on new, unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Avoid Overfitting**: To ensure the model generalizes well and isn't just memorizing the training data.\n",
    "3. **Parameter Tuning**: To find the optimal settings for our model to achieve the best performance.\n",
    "4. **Comparison**: To compare different models and select the best one for our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and Explore the Dataset**: Understand the structure and content of the Iris dataset.\n",
    "2. **Preprocess the Data**: Split the data into training and testing sets to prepare for model training and evaluation.\n",
    "3. **Define a Model**: Choose a machine learning model to evaluateâ€”in this case, a Support Vector Machine (SVM).\n",
    "4. **Perform Cross-Validation**: Assess the model's performance through cross-validation to check its robustness and reliability.\n",
    "5. **Perform Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use grid search to find the best hyperparameters for our model to improve its performance.\n",
    "6. **Evaluate the Model Using Metrics**: Calculate various performance metrics to quantify how well the model is performing on the test set.\n"
